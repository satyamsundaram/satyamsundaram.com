Hi, I’m Satyam Sundaram.

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer by profession but I also love building products that people love. I like to dig deep and think from first principles when approaching any problem that's new and interesting.

This site is a long-term log of my thinking, learning and building. Across tech, economy, culture and life.
